# CSS

What does CSS do?

- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
  - Examples of style:
    - Width and height, Borders (color, width, and style), Background color and images, Position in the browser window.
    
  - Text
    - Typeface, Size, Color, Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps.
    
 - CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
  - These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: 
    - a selector 
    - a declaration.
    
- CSS Properties affect how elements Are displayed.
    - CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: 
      - a property, a value, separated by a colon. 
      - You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
