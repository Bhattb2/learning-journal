# Comparison Operators

- What is comparison operator?
    - A comparison (or relational) operator is a mathematical symbol which is used to compare two values. Comparison operators are used in       conditions that compares one expression with another. The result of a comparison can be TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN (an operator that         has one or two NULL expressions returns UNKNOWN).

- What is the purpose of comparison operators?
    - The following operators are used to compare values in a conditional and return either TRUE or FALSE. The comparison operators can         safely be used with all four data types. â–ª == is the equivalency operator used to compare two values. It returns TRUE if both             arguments are equal; otherwise it returns FALSE.

# For and While

- What is a for loop and while loop?
    - The initialization is an assignment statement that is used to set the loop control variable. The condition is a relational                 expression that determines when the loop exits. The increment defines how the loop control variable changes each time the loop is         repeated. ... The loop iterates while the condition is true.
    - What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
    - The difference is that the do while loop executes at least once because it checks for the loop condition while exiting. While is a         entry controlled loop and do while is a exit control loop. Whereas in do while loop it will enter the loop and will then check for         the condition.
